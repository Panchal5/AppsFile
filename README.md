The Leave Management App built in Microsoft PowerApps allows employees to apply for leaves and managers to approve or reject requests digitally.

Users can log in as “User” to apply for leave or “Manager” to approve requests.

Employees can submit new leave requests by selecting the leave type, dates, reason, and attaching supporting documents if required.

Once submitted, the request appears under “My Leave Request” for tracking.

Managers receive email notifications for approvals and can take action directly from the app or via mobile.

Users can also view their leave balance (total entitlement and availed leaves) in the “My Leave Balance” tab.

The system streamlines leave application and approval processes, improving efficiency and record accuracy.
